# FunctionalSetOperations

## Performs set operations on two files with a non-iteration, partially functional approach

### Overview:

Functional Set Operations uses Python and JavaScript along with recursive string manipulation
and parsing functions in order to perform set operations such as **union**, **intersection**,
and **difference** on two files

### Usage:
#### Both files should be in the same directory/file as script (You can edit path in getset() function)

* Python
    * Usage: python setops.py "set1=\<file1\>;set2=\<file2\>;operation=\<operation\>"
* JS
    * Usage: node setops.js "set1=\<file1\>;set2=\<file2\>;operation=\<operation\>"
